A template for creating a professional-looking, PDF-format CV or résumé. Aimed at users with limited or no prior experience using a typesetting software such as LaTeX.

## Get Started

### Requirements

A TeX distribution is the only software dependency necessary for working on this project. Depending on your OS, MikTex, TeXLive or MacTeX are good options &mdash; they are free and open-source through [The LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

Also consider installing a dedicated GUI (e.g. TeXworks or TeXstudio), that will make working with TeX files easier.

Alternatively, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an cloud-based LaTeX editor that doesn't require any local installation.

### Step One: Download

1. Navigate to Pedro-h-mattos/LaTeXCVTemplate.
2. Above the list of files, click **<> Code**.
3. Click **Download ZIP**.

You should have obtained a copy of the repository's files, that you can edit on your local computer. Begin by unzipping the file `LaTeXCVTemplate-main.zip`.

### Step Two: Usage 
At the command line, run the command: 

```
pdflatex CVexample.tex
```

Or, compile `CVexample.tex` from within a TeX editor. 

Doing either should output the document `CVexample.pdf`. This is a template you can use to build a CV or résumé.

If you are already familiar with LaTeX, you can edit `CVexample.tex` directly. Otherwise, open the document `instructions.pdf`, which contains a guide to editing your template.
