A template for creating a professional-looking, PDF-format CV or résumé. Aimed at users with limited or no prior experience using a typesetting software such as LaTeX.

## Get Started

### Requirements

A TeX distribution is the only software dependency necessary for working on this project. Depending on your OS, MikTex, TeXLive or MacTeX are good options --- they are free and open-source at [The LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

Also consider installing a dedicated GUI for working with TeX files (e.g. TeXworks or TeXstudio). 

Alternatively, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an cloud-based LaTeX editor that doesn't require any local installation.

### How to Download this Repository

1. Navigate to Pedro-h-mattos/LaTeXCVTemplate
2. Above the list of files, click **<> Code**.
3. Click **Download ZIP*

You should have obtained a copy of the repository's files, that you can edit on your local computer. Begin by unzipping the file `LaTeXCVTemplate-main.zip`.

### Usage
At a command prompt, run the command: 

```
pdflatex CVexample.tex
```

Or, compile *CVexample.tex* from within a TeX editor. 

Doing either should output the document `CVexample.pdf`, which is a template. If you are already familiar with LaTeX, you can edit this now.

Otherwise, open the document `instructions.pdf`, which contains a guide to editing your template.
