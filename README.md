A template for creating a professional-looking, PDF-format CV or r\'esum\'e. Aimed at users with limited or no prior experience using a typesetting software such as LaTeX.

## Get Started

### Requirements

A TeX distribution is the only software dependency necessary for working on this project. Depending on your OS, MikTex, TeXLive or MacTeX are good options --- they are free and open-source at [The LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

Additionally, consider installing a dedicated GUI for working with TeX files (e.g. TeXworks or TeXstudio). 

Alternatively, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an cloud-based LaTeX editor that doesn't require any local installation.
