\section{Get Started}
Hopefully, this is the first file that you opened. Without a \TeX~distribution, only \emph{README.pdf} should be accessible to you. (We'll get to the other files later). \par

This document is intended to be an `instruction manual' for creating a CV, or r\'esum\'e, using the typsetting system \LaTeX. \par

It isn't intended to be a `Hello World' style tutorial. A better introduction to the software can be found at \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn\_LaTeX\_in\_30\_minutes}. \par

Instructions are always provided as follows: \par

\begin{instrct}
This is an instruction.
\end{instrct}

Ocassionally, an extension task will prompt you with a more complicated task. Don't worry, these are optional. \par

\begin{ext}
This is an optional task.
