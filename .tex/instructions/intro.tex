\section{Introduction}
This project provides a template to create a curriculum vitae, or r\'esum\'e. It is intended as a `fast-introduction' to typsetting with \LaTeX, for someone with little, or no experience in the subject. \par

Inspiration came about by the realisation that students might be better-motivated to learn \LaTeX~if the benefits for doing so were more obvious. Students, inundated with assignments and (oh no!) exams, are unwilling to waste precious time grappling with new software. Especially when the results are comparable to what can be achieved using Microsoft Word. Most tutorials, intended for beginners, start gently with `Hello World'; instead, this template rewards the user with a CV, or r\'esum\'e. \par

This project introduces the class file \lstinline|articleCV.cls| and \TeX~file \lstinline|CVexample.tex|, which together construct the template. The main parts of this document are concerned with reading and editing .tex and .cls files, parsing documentation and navigating a project directory. More attention is given to the construction of the class file in the appendix; which I imagine would be of more interest to the experienced \LaTeX~user. \par
