Take a moment to examine your document. What do you notice? 

Although very neatly typset, your `personalised' r\'esum\'e lacks any personal information at all! \emph{CVexample.tex} is designed as a customisable template; the rest of this exercise will guide you in replacing each section of this document. \par

Now consider the structure of the template itself. How many sections does it contain? Can you identify any elements that are repeated? \par

The structure of a r\'esum\'e document is fairly standardized. Personal and/or contact information is usually placed in the document header and sections should correspond to a person's education, work experience, skills, publications, etc. \par

Here, the document header can be subdivided into three elements: a title, the author's name, and their personal and contact information; centered on the page. The latter of which is organised into two columns. \par 

The three sections, labelled \emph{Education/Qualifications}, \emph{Technical Skills} and \emph{Experience}, are always underlined and followed by subsections describing relevant experience. These subsections always compose two lines of text; one bold and larger, and the other italicized and smaller, that may or may not extend across the page. Optionally, a subsection can be followed by one or more bullet points. \par
